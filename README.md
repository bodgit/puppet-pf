## Description

This module manages the packet filter (pf) firewall primarily found on
OpenBSD. It manages the `/etc/pf.conf` configuration file containing the
firewall rules. It can also manage the user shell (authpf) used for
implementing an authenticating gateway.

OpenBSD is supported using Puppet 4.5.0 or later.

## Setup

### Beginning with pf

To use the default example ruleset:

```puppet
class { '::pf':
  source => '/etc/examples/pf.conf',
}
```

## Usage

To set up the authenticating gateway:

```puppet
include ::bsdauth
include ::bsdauth::authpf

class { '::pf':
  content => @(EOS/L),
    int_if="em0"
    ...
    Å¥able <authpf_users> persist
    ...
    anchor "authpf/*" in on $int_if
    ...
    | EOS
}

class { '::pf::authpf':
  rules => @(EOS/L),
    int_if="em0"
    ...
    pass in on $int_if inet from <authpf_users> to ! $int_if:network \
      keep state
    ...
    | EOS
}

group { 'alice':
  ensure => present,
}

user { 'alice':
  ensure     => present,
  gid        => 'alice',
  loginclass => 'authpf',
  managehome => true,
}
```
